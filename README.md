### Set-Up instructions
#### By using of the sync prompt for node, i have binded the the terminal and the program so that it can accept user inputs when run to avoid manually inputing of the data. I also gave brief explanations of the codes using comments.


### Challenge 1 - Grade-genarator (Toy Problem)

#### I have written a program that prompts the user to input student marks. I have made this possible by using the prompt-sync package that is used to get user input synchronously.
#### The input which are the marks should be between 0 and 100 and if not it throws an error "Invalid input! Mark should be between 0 and 100."
#### The outputs correspond to the correct grades; A for marks greater than 79, B for marks between 60 to 79, C for marks between 59 to 49, D for marks between 40 to 49 and lastly grade E for marks less than 40.


### Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)

#### <b> I have written a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than or equal to 70, it prints out an “Ok” message. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it gives the driver one demerit point and prints out the total number of demerit points.
#### In this case, if the speed is 80, it prints out: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function prints out: “License suspended”. <b>


### Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)

#### For the third challenge i have written a program where its major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary.
