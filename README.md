## Grade-genarator

### I have written a function that prompts the user to input student marks. I have made this possible by using the prompt-sync package that is used to get user input synchronously.

### The input which are the marks should be between 0 and 100 and if not it throws an error "Invalid input! Mark should be between 0 and 100."

### The outputs correspond to the correct grades; A for marks greater than 79, B for marks between 60 to 79, C for marks between 59 to 49, D for marks between 40 to 49 and lastly grade E for marks less than 40.
